Encrypting nvpvar

All Web Services described on this website utilize a nvpvar variable that contains the encrypted value of some credential information. Below are the steps to take for encrypting this value.

Create a JSON struct of data by either serializing your argument collection within your HTTP POST; or by manually creating a JSON structure of required variables, which are then serialized into key pair values. For more information about JSON, please click here.  http://www.json.org/

json_struct {
clientid = 'your-client-id',
username = 'your-username',
passcode = 'your-password',
apikey = 'your-api-key'
}

set variable = serializeJSON( json_struct )

Zip the string using zlib compression.

Pad the string with spaces so the length is divisible by 16.

Encrypt the string using AES256-ECB.
ASCII values displayed in the example below.

Note: To ensure proper security, a unique Encryption Key will be provided by SLA for each user. This key will need to be used when encrypting the nvpvar value. In this example, the key used was: jfhdusywlf83jx@37$2idksu9Kdheokq

Convert encrypted value to a URL safe Base64 string.

Assign the value to the nvpvar variable in the POST request:

For the LOGIN SERVICE, your API Key is encrypted and passed with your username, client ID and password.

You will be required to decrypt the login reponse to extract the session ID needed for all other web services.
