						<h4>Economic Hardship</h4>

							<ul>
								<li>Receiving federal or state welfare aid;</li>
								<li>Earning less than 150% of the federal poverty guidelines for your family size; and</li>
								<li>Serving in the Peace Corps.</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<p>How Long Does It Last? - You can request this deferment for up to 3 years</p>

						
						<h4>Graduate Fellowship</h4>
						<p>Postponement available if you are enrolled full time in an eligible graduate fellowship program and hold at least a bachelor's degree. The graduate fellowship program must certify your participation.</p>
						<p>How Long Does It Last? - You can use this deferment until you withdraw from or complete the fellowship program.</p>

						
						<h4>In-School<h4>
						<p>Postponement for when you are enrolled at an accredited school.
						<p>If you are a new borrower as of July 1, 1993, you must be enrolled at least half time. Definitions of half-time enrollment vary by school—it’s important to know how your school defines this. If you are a pre-July 1, 1993 borrower, you may need to be enrolled full time to be eligible for this deferment. Parent PLUS borrowers have always been able to use this deferment based on their own enrollment in an eligible school. However, borrowers of Parent PLUS loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2008, can use this deferment based on the enrollment of the student benefitting from the loan. The benefitting student must be enrolled at least half-time.</p>
						<p>How Long Does It Last? - There is no maximum amount of time for this deferment as long as you meet the criteria.

						
						<h4>Military</h4>
						<p>Postponement if you are serving on active duty—or qualifying National Guard duty—during a war, a military operation, or a national emergency. You must certify active duty and submit a copy of your military orders.</p>
						<p>How Long Does It Last? - There is no maximum time limit—as long as you qualify, you will be granted this deferment from the time you enter active duty. This deferment will end 180 days after you are demobilized.</p>

						
						<h4>Rehabilitation Training</h4>
						<p>Postponement available if you are engaged in a full-time program—30 hours a week for 3 months—of vocation rehabilitation, drug or alcohol abuse treatment, or mental health treatment. The program must be licensed, certified, or otherwise recognized as providing rehabilitation training by a responsible state agency or the Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>
						<p>A program official must certify the borrower’s participation.</p>
						<p>How Long Does It Last? - You can use this deferment until you withdraw from or complete the rehabilitation training program.</p>

						
						<h4>Unemployment</h4>

						<p>
							In addition, you must be either:
							<ul>
								<li>Receiving unemployment benefits;</li>
								<li>Registered with an employment agency within 50 miles of your home.

							</ul>
						</p>
